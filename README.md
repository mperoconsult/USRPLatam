# Experiments with a holographic radar based on Software Defined Radio

1. **GNU Radio companion**
The code contains the GNU Radio Companion Code that implements a holographic radar, operating with the NI URSP B210 Software Defined Radio.

2. **Building blocks, hardware**
   The following blocks were used to perform the holographic radar. Modifications should be performed in case of different frequencies.

3. **Requirements**
   Windows or Linux OS, the main bottleneck is the USB port type, preferred 3.0. In case the USRP sample rate is set too high, samples might be lost.
   GNU Radio companion building blocks are standard, so even old versions of it are likely to work.
